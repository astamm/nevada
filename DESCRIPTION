Description: This package containes tools for the statistical analysis of network-valued data.
    Given two samples of networks it is possible to test if they came from the same population via two test
    statistics based on four different types of distances. The user can also choose which distance to use. 
    It is important to note that in some cases different distances and different test statistics can lead to
    different results.
